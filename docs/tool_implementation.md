# Tools to Implement

## Offensive Tools
### Peirates
Peirates, a Kubernetes penetration tool, enables an attacker to escalate privilege and pivot through a Kubernetes cluster. It automates known techniques to steal and collect service account tokens, secrets, obtain further code execution, and gain control of the cluster.

### CDK - Zero Dependency Container Penetration Toolkit
CDK is an open-sourced container penetration toolkit, designed for offering stable exploitation in different slimmed containers without any OS dependency. It comes with useful net-tools and many powerful PoCs/EXPs and helps you to escape container and take over K8s cluster easily.

### Botb
BOtB is a container analysis and exploitation tool designed to be used by pentesters and engineers.
https://github.com/brompwnie/botb

### Kdigger
kdigger, short for "Kubernetes digger", is a context discovery tool for Kubernetes penetration testing. This tool is a compilation of various plugins called buckets to facilitate pentesting Kubernetes from inside a pod.

## Adversary Simulation/Emulation
### Stratus Red Team
Stratus Red Team is "Atomic Red Teamâ„¢" for the cloud, allowing to emulate offensive attack techniques in a granular and self-contained manner.
